# AI Art Platforms: A Statistical Approach to Popularity and Pricing Trends:

**Problem:** Which platform performs best for AI-generated art and tell which platform to choose with respect to below mentioned visulas?

**Tools:** Pandas + Seaborn/Matplotlib, normalized composite metrics.

**Visuals:**

- Avg price per platform
- Avg engagement score per platform
- Creator-type popularity per platform

**Summary**

 • Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on AI-generated art platforms using Python (Pd, Sns, plt).
 • Aggregated and visualized key metrics like average price, engagement score, and creator-type distribution per platform.
 • Applied Z-score normalization to standardize metrics for fair comparison across platforms.
 • Identified top-performing platform through statistical analysis and presented insights with multi-layered visualizations.
